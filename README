1. Lambert lighting models scatter the light that it reflects equally in all directions and the intenesity depends on angle of incoming light. The phong model uses four vectors to calculate a color for a point. 

2. My extra feature is a border around the shapes and a different background. I integrated it beacuse it didn't compromise the style of the scene and I thought it looked cool.

3. I learned how to change the lighting, and move objects around the scene, and update the scene with the GUI. I am most satisfied by figuring out how to change all the shapes at once.

4. The biggest challenge was also what I was most satisfied in accomplishing.

5. I am thinking about simulating a baseball game. The theme is something to do with sports.

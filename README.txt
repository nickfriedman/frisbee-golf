This is a frisbee-golf computer graphics game. 

A: Move direction arrow left
D: Move direction arrow right
W: Tilt frisbee up
S: Tilt frisbee down
Spacebar: Throw frisbee, and allow the frisbee to continue to move.

1: Close up view of the hole
2: Minimap camera that will take a topdown view of the field.
3: Return camera to behind the disc.


This runs on both Safari and Firefox.

We accomplished all our objectives except we haven't been able to get the trees and hole to have shadows, only the disc.
